## Forecasting Hospital Growth with Quarterly Financials and Utilization Data

### Summary

This project is an exploration of quarterly financial and utilization data from hospitals in Washtington and Oregon states. The central goal is predicting whether a hospital will grow from year to year. Growth is measured by comparing financial data from a quarter to the same quarter in the previous year.

### Data

Data for Washtingon hospitals are made available through the [washington state open data portal](https://data.wa.gov/) as the Hospital-Financial-Quarterly-Aggregate-Report. Data was originally sourced from the Washington State Department of Health and further documentation is available [here](https://doh.wa.gov/data-statistical-reports/healthcare-washington/hospital-and-patient-data/hospital-financial-data).

Data for Oregon hospitals are made available through the Oregon Health Authority as monthtly reported data [here](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/Hospital-Reporting-Databank.aspx)
